Today, I'll be showing you a simple way to make a wordcloud of news headlines in python!

If you haven't read this tutorial explaining how to scrape news headlines in python, make sure you do.
In summary, here's the code for scraping news headlines in python:

To create a wordcloud out of these news headlines, first import these 2 libraries beside the libraries needed to scrape our news source:

First create a wordcloud(well, more like a box in this case) sized 500 by 500.

Next, our wordcloud will be created using "plt.imshow()" (interpolation='bilinear' just makes the words in the wordcloud easier to read).

plt.axis("off") and plt.margins(x=0, y=0) make sure our wordcloud isn't displayed as a graph.

_Finally, our wordcloud is displayed using "plt.show()".
