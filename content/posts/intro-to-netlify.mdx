## Welcome to Netlify
Netlify is an all-in-one platform for automating modern web projects. Replace your hosting infrastructure, continuous integration, and deployment pipeline with a single workflow. Integrate dynamic functionality like serverless functions, user authentication, and form handling as your projects grow.

## Get started
To get started with Netlify, learn how to create deploys. Options for creating deploys range from connecting a Git repository for continuous deployment to publishing a site folder with drag and drop. Use the Deploy to Netlify button on our Jamstack templates to create a Git repository linked to a Netlify site that you can experiment with.

## Discover Netlify
Explore our documentation to learn about Netlify products and features. Here are some highlights from each section of the docs:

Configure builds – Netlify can run your build command and deploy the result whenever you push to your Git repo. Get started with basic build settings, learn about managing build dependencies, and explore additional options available with file-based configuration.

Site deploys – Atomic deploys with Netlify guarantee that your site is always consistent. Learn how to manage deploys, enable deploy notifications, and run a branch-based split test. Use the power of Deploy Previews to review site changes and collaborate with team members.
