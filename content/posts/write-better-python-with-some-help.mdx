When I started shifting more and more towards working with Python, I looked back at the world of JS and thought wow, they have so many nice tools for formatting and linting! I found myself in the wild world of Python programming where PEP8 sets the standards, but whether or not you follow them and how you write your code is pretty much up to you. This is my letter to myself back in time, to share some of the tips I now have in my toolbox for maintaining a nice and clean Python project.

## Formatting
If you want to speed up your coding and rely on a computer to do the polishing for you, you can use a code formatter to automatically walk through and format your code. In the world of python, Black is one of the most used formatters. It could be compared to Prettier in the world of JS - they are both opinionated formatters, i.e. they make some choices for you. (You don't have to fight your colleague over whether to use single or double quotes anymore! Great!)

## Linting
Linting differs from formatting in that it will not change the code it looks at, but will notify you if it doesn't follow the specified standards. A good option for linting in python is flake8. Here is how flake8 responds to the same file contents as black did above.
