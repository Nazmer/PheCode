## Getting started
All source codes related to the blog are under [components](/src/components) and [pages](/src/pages) directory.
You can modify it freely if you want to apply your design theme.
All components use [styled-jsx](https://github.com/vercel/styled-jsx) and [css-modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) to define their styles, but you can choose any styling libraries for designing your theme.

The directory tree containing the blog source code are described below:

```
meta: yaml files defining metadata like authors or tags
public: images, favicons and other static assets
src
├── assets: other assets using inside of components
├── components: pieces of components consisting of pages
├── content: mdx files for each post page
├── lib: project libraries like data fetching or pagination
└── pages: page components managing by Next.js
```
### Organizing content by categories

The category metadata that associates with content have the same relationship with the authors' one.
Then reference these implementations for adding new metadata:

- [public/admin/config.yml](/public/admin/config.yml#L51): author metadata definition for Netlify CMS
- [src/lib/authors.tsx](/src/lib/authors.ts): fetches metadata and defines utility functions for components
- [meta/authors.yml](/src/meta/authors.yml): author content managed by Netlify CMS
- [src/components/PostLayout.tsx](/src/components/PostLayout.tsx): displays author content for each page
